# Hybrid Expert Chatbot

**Hybrid Expert Chatbot** is an intelligent conversational agent that combines rule-based logic with machine learning techniques to deliver accurate, dynamic, and context-aware responses. It is designed to simulate expert decision-making, making it ideal for virtual assistants, support systems, academic bots, and domain-specific helpdesks.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create a chatbot that leverages the structured power of expert systems (rules, decision trees) with the flexibility of modern AI (NLP, learning algorithms) to provide users with human-like and informative interactions.

---

## 💡 Key Features

- 🔁 **Rule-Based Processing**  
  Utilizes predefined conditions and logical flows for deterministic responses in known scenarios.

- 🤖 **AI-Driven NLP**  
  Handles unstructured queries using natural language understanding and trained models.

- 🔍 **Intent Recognition**  
  Identifies user intentions for accurate routing of queries.

- 🧠 **Hybrid Response Engine**  
  Blends rule-based and AI responses for optimal accuracy and flexibility.

- 📊 **Scalable Design**  
  Easily extendable to new domains, intents, and response formats.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

| Component         | Purpose                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Python 3.x        | Core programming                            |
| NLTK / spaCy      | NLP and language understanding              |
| scikit-learn      | Machine learning classification (if used)   |
| Flask / Streamlit | (Optional) Web interface for deployment     |
| JSON / YAML       | Rule-base and intents definition            |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HybridExpertChatbot.git
cd HybridExpertChatbot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Chatbot

```bash
python main.py
```

Or run with UI (if implemented):

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User inputs a query**
2. **Intent classifier determines the nature of the input**
3. **If a rule exists**, it returns a predefined expert response
4. **If not**, it routes to the AI engine for contextual interpretation
5. **Response is generated and sent back to the user**
